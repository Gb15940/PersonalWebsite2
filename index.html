        FNaF
    </h3>

    <p>
        My favorite fandom of all time is actually, as per my username on basically every platform I'm on, FNaF! 
        <br>Five Nights at Freddys is a horror game franchise 
        that involves five creepy animatronics that are haunted by dead kids 
        that try to murder the nightguard from 12 - 6 AM.
        <br>In the game you play as the nightguard in most situations,
        and you survive the night by flashing the lights, closing the doors, and various other things in different games.

        My current fixation at the moment!
    </h3>

    <p>
        Deadpool and Wolverine are my most recent and current hyperfixation as I'm gonna try and see the movie soon.
        <br>In my opinion, and I absolutely understand that there's a ton of different opinions,
        <br>But I totally ship Deadpool and Wolverine. There's no way they don't flirt. There is absolutely no way that they're not at least a little bit gay.
